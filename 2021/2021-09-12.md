# Drift gamepad

    Subject: Drift gamepad on PS5

    Hello.
    In the updated version of the Ghost of Tsushima for the PlayStation 5 console,
    there was a problem, the control of the left stick is too sensitive and
    therefore the character itself moves. Drift compensation in game settings
    doesn't help.  Correct it if possible. Thanks.

    If this letter was sent to the wrong address, then forward it to the
    game developers.
