# device was rooted

    Subject: My device was rooted (or maybe even rootkitted w/out my knowledge nor
    my permission.

    How do I fix it and remove all the coding commands and issues it has
    caused. Idk the first thing about coding, nor do I honesty even care to even
    try to. I’ve never even owned a computer not once in my life and I’m damn
    near 50. I didn’t agree to doing it and the sobs that did keep trying to take
    over my device/devices and make themselves device administrator. Smh... I
    really really need some help man. I want this to stop and I want the issues
    fixed and just want a peace of mind and to not have to deal with any of the
    nonsense. I work to much and can’t afford to have my phone to not be working
    cuz some azzholes shut it down. SMH please help if possible and thanks for
    your time and services.
