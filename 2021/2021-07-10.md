    Subject: possible bug

    Hi! I didn't find other way to contact with PoB developers, so writing here -
    please redirect this letter to proper people.  I think i found bug when i'm
    using nightblade support (with dual strike for example) while having
    varunastra equipped (2 obviously), it doesn't add any crit multi to my main
    skill while under elusive effect! (elusive checked at Configuration) Supported
    Skills can only be used with Claws or Daggers looks like nightblade don't
    recognize that my varunastra counts as all weapon types i swapped varunastras
    for Rive claw for test, and it's working flawlessly!
