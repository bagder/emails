# SKY box

    Subject: help please

    Good  Morning Mr Stenberg,
    I hope that you can help me.  Do you have anything to do with SKY box
    software?  We are having trouble with the audio, To listen to anything through
    SKY we have to have tv volume at nearly full.  When we switch back to
    terrestrial tv we are nearly blown out the room.  This has been going on for
    years.  It seems all SKY 2tb box,s are just the same.

    Kind regards

    [name] (retired SKY engineer)
