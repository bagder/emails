    Subject: K-win64-x86

    Hi, I read your code at https://github.com/ctubio/Krypto-trading-bot.
    I see you as a very professional person!.
    I'm having trouble researching when you don't open the library
    K-win64-x86_64.0.a and K-win64-x86_64.1.a.
    I want to understand how you handle in static Gw *new_Gw(const string &);
    Can you please send me your library code, I want to study and learn. Thank
    you very much.

(I have no code on that URL and have no association with it)
