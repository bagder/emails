    Subject: HAKSIZ BAN

    Dear PUBG developer, recently my account is on your side. It was banned,
    although I do not accept this ban, I strongly object. My account has been
    banned and removed from the game for no reason, no evidence and there is no
    inappropriate behavior such as evidence. if if my account had an act that
    violated your rules I want proof that shows. Have a good idea of ​​reopening my
    account I'm waiting for news, have a nice day.
