    Subject: Trouble updating Wt Library

    Brother Daniel Stenberg

    We have the Wt Library and have not been able to update it since June 2020.
    Are updates still available? I have followed the directions in the Help
    section for auto update. If a file is available, we could try that too, but I
    do not have an update File.

    Best regards
