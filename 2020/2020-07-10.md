# iDrive Software

    Subject: iDrive Software

    Daniel -

    I recently purchased a 2009 BMW Z4. The iDrive software indicates “Copyright
    (c) 1996-2010, Daniel Stenberg).  I’ve purchased a video interface that allows
    me to add a backup camera. However, the interface requires that I update the
    iDrive software to the latest version from BMW. However, there is no software
    update function within the current iDrive menu. Is there a way to revert the
    iDrive to the original or current software?

    Thank you for any help you can offer.

    Respectfully,
