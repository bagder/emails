# kworking

    Dear Mr. Steinberg,

    I am currently cleaning up the hard drives on our server.
    I find a directory called "kworking" on every drive.
    There is a "curl.exe" file in the directory

    What is this application?

    Thank you in advance for your information!

    Best regards,
