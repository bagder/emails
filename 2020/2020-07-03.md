    Subject: Need help

    Dear Daniel

    I am a small time Human Rights activist and they have hacked my computer in
    order to prevent my case coming before the ECHR.  Basically they have hacked
    my email to make it seem that a case that was sent to the Attorney General of
    Portugal was never received and yet they gave me a case number which would
    indicate that something was received.  What can I do to retrieve this if
    anything. If you can help I would be grateful and although a 72 year old
    pensioner I will continue speaking truth to power.

    And I will make a contribution for your services.
    Best regards
    [name]
