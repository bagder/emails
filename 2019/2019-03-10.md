    Subject: CameraAccess v1.7.1

    Hello Daniel

    I’m writing this suggest a future enhancement that would gladly be appreciated
    by all Canon users.  The remote access works well with my Pixia HF R42 to a
    point. However recording can only be done in Auto mode. It would be a
    tremendous plus if allowed to record in other modes. Especially Program
    mode. Sometimes shooting thru tree, the auto focus will not focus on
    background, only the foreground. That’s a killer. Programming white Balance,
    shutter speed and so on enhances the video greatly. I would appreciate in the
    future to allow manual settings when using the app.

    Thank you for your support of this app. 
    Sincerley,
