    Subject: Why?

    Your software is showing up across all my devices... I don't know if it was
    done by you guys or (I assume) elsewhere, but want to know if so, why did
    this happen?

    And how do I clear this out of my devices? I've reformatted everything
    multiple times...

    Thanks...
