    Subject: Hey cool game idea

    Hey, I'm from Houston and I saw your email on Outer Worlds intellectual
    property notice. Hey, I just wanted to pitch a game idea to you, thought it
    would be cool.  It's a three in a row solver with a twist. It has a map that
    is like, a six sided cube. This map you swipe to solve the cube with each
    simple level solved.
