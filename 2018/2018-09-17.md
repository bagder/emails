# Cisco anyconnect

    Hello Daniel,

    I’ve a question and hopefully you can point me in the right directions.
    We are using CISCO AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client (version: 4.6.0199)
    and we are deploying this app via jamf through our iPhones.

    Via jamf deployment we see that the new version of the app is sent to the
    devices and successfully installed. However the configuration profile (such
    as settings) don’t install. Via jamf we see that the command is successfully
    executed. But when we look at the device no settings are actually being
    installed.

    We have been testing this on all types of iPhone series and OS 11 and 12
    series.

    Hopefully you can point us in the right direction. Hope to hear from you.

    Kind regards,
    [name]
    Mission Critical Engineer
