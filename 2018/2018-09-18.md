    Hi wargaming.net team,

    I found your contact details in your websiteâ€™s privacy policy. As the
    privacy team for wargaming.net, please be informed that we found a few
    vulnerabilities that put your website at risk for GDPR non-compliance.  I've
    already reached out a few times to see if it makes sense to connect regarding
    a GDPR report I have for wargaming.net. Since I haven't heard back from you,
    I'll assume the timing isn't right.  As a reminder, our report highlights some
    vulnerabilities in the way you collect and share personal data with your data
    processors, which can easily turn into personal data leaks and breaches if
    left unmonitored.
