    hello, can you tell me how to hack into web site:
    [FIRST URL]
    so it is showing:

    [OTHER URL]
    when you click on a link in google results?

    for example if you click on a google result:
    [URL to a google.rs search for something on the FIRST URL site]

    the point is i would like to protect my web site form that kind of attack
    so please let me know how to do that
