# so hacked already

    Subject: Thanks

    This device is so hacked already, that you would only further implicate
    yourself or anyone there after both in remote connection as well as device
    id and location/name and address. Kasshole moerder has done enough damage
    here. I'm clean up damage mitigation specialist/controller. [redacted] sent
    me I suppose. HS English/history. And I am aware of his abuses done to him
    as to why his name changed. One of the at the time worst... So. I have
    never had the ball here. Just been keeping the world from exploding on a
    macro and micro level constantly.
