# UNBLOCK

    Subject: [redacted] Software Inc.

    Hi Daniel

    Please view the supporting documents and provide a moment of your time.

    I have been blocked by [redacted] in customer support for two years now as
    rather than offering support He maliciously blocked me from support and
    upgrades.

    I spent over £1000 on [redacted] products in the two years purchases were
    allowed on my account but he has blocked me from ALL PURCHASES RENDERING MY
    SOFTWARE (Which I spent over £1000 on) UNUPGRADABLE

    As such I want to bring your poor Trustpilot review of 88% poor service to I
    am not the 1% as Michael explains in the screenshots I have saved for my
    lawyer, if you were not to unblock me.

    Without a portal it has been near impossible to voice my concerns but to put
    it simple:

    PLEASE RESTORE MY [redacted] FULL UPGRADABLE FUNCTIONS IMEDIATELY AND I EXPECT
    AN APPOLOGY AS I ONLY COMLAINED TWICE THAT YEAR AND AM NOT AN ANNOYNG CUSTOMER
    I EXPECTED A RESPONSE AND REPEATEDLY RECEIVED ZERO HELP HELP IS THE SERVICE I
    EXPECT....  NOT RUDENESS MALICIOUSNESS AND IGNORANCE AND I HAVE TOTTED UP ALL
    MY PURCHASES WITH PROOF OF PAYMENT AND KEPT ALL SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS.

    PLEASE FIND ATTACHED AND UNBLOCK ME ASAP.

    Kind Regards
