# Collected emails

This is a collection of emails I have received over the years. I have tried to
remove all names, email addresses and some company names.

Except the redaction of personal identifiable information, the contents of the
emails are shown exactly as I received them.

The emails tend to be in one of these categories.

- Accusing me of wrongdoings

- Thinking I'm responsible for or know anything about a product (that probably
  uses curl)

- Random weirdness

To the best of my knowledge, none of these emails were sent ironically or as
jokes.

## Start here

Read them [here](https://daniel.haxx.se/email/).

## Who am I?

I am [Daniel Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se). I am the lead developer of
[curl](https://curl.se/). curl runs in some twenty billion installations
worldwide. The curl license appears in many places and contains my email
address.

## Do I respond?

I used to. Over time I learned that is very hard to bridge the knowledge gap,
plus the fact that many users will just consider whatever I say as excuses for
not helping them the way they want.

It simple takes too much time and energy. I almost never respond to these
emails anymore.
