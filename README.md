# Collected emails

This is a collection of emails I have received over the years. I have tried to
remove all names, emails and some company names.

The emails tend to be in one of these categories.

- Accusing me of wrongdoings.

- Thinking I'm responsible for or know anything about a product (that probably
  uses curl)

- random weirdness

## Who am I ?

I am [Daniel Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se). I am the lead developer of
curl. curl is installed in some twenty billion installations worldwide. The
curl license appears in many places and it contains my email address.

Each email contains links in the bottom that easily continue to the next.
