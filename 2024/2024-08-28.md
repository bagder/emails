# Learn to Play the Piano

    Subject: Idea to Enhance Learn to Play the Piano on Nintendo Switch

    Hello Daniel Stenberg,

    The idea is to make the software assessable to the blind
    community as an education tool.

    Please consider putting an adio que with the ability to slow
    or speed tempo. This could be combined with midi/drum boards
    as well for muscle memory, which might even be able to have
    use in orchestral settings.

    Thank you for your time.
