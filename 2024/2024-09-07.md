# DDoS service using you

    Subject: DDoS service using you

    error
    
    CURL ERROR: 7: FAILED TO
    CONNECT TO 127.0.0.1 PORT
    8000: CONNECTION REFUSED
    (SEE
    HTTPS://CURL.HAXX.SE/LIBCURL/C/LIBCURL-ERRORS.HTML) FOR
    HTTP://127.0.0.1:8000/API/V1/ORDER/CREATE-TRANSATION
    
The body consisted of nothing abut a screenshot of a message from something. I
have manually OCR'ed to text here. It is oddly uppercased which of course will
prevent the curl URL from actually working.
