# Rainbow 6 Siege Activation issue

    Dear Daniel!

    My name is [name]. I found your contact in a licens.txt file
    in the Rainbow 6 Siege files. I don't want to bother you,
    but I could not find any solution to the problem. I bought
    the game on the 20th nov 2017. on steam. At that time i
    could play it. Then i did not have anybody to play with so
    i've stopped playing it. Now i've installed it again, but
    when the steam start the ubisoft app, the ubisoft app keeps
    asking me for a serial number, but now there isn't any
    serial key to it anywhere. I wrote to every support, to the
    ubisoft and the steam but nobody answers. I send you my
    receipt from the purches.

    Where can i find it. Is there a method to fix this?

    Thank you for your time!
    Humble regards:
    [name]
