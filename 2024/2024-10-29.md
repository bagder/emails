# Yamaha Piano

    Subject: Yamaha Piano

    Hello,

    I am reaching out once more about my late husband's Yamaha
    piano, which i am offering to anyone who would genuinely
    cherish it. If you or someone you know would be interested in
    receiving this instrument as a gift, please feel free to get
    in touch.

    Warm regards,
    [name]

Why why why?

After I first published this, I looked deeper in my spambox and noticed a few
other similarly phrased emails from different persons, all offering their late
husband's pianos. It is not unlikely that this is some kind of scam attempt
intro.

Possibly they found my email in a piano (app) that uses curl. Or perhaps not.
