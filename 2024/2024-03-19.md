# Hammerwatch 2

    Subject: When will there be a patch for the console version of
    Hammerwatch 2?!

    I emailed your company two or three times, but you never
    responded!!

    The game came out in December last year, and it's absurd that it
    was released with problems, but I think it was a scam to leave it
    silently for 3 months.

    So what I want to ask is, are you going to fix it!?
    How much is left to fix!?

    When I load it in multiplayer, the game crashes without even
    trying. How can they release something like this!?

    What are we going to do about it when there is still no notice
    and no solution!?

    Are you saying you got paid for the game anyway!?

    In the case of Nintendo Switch and PlayStation, refunds are
    difficult like Steam. Can this be considered a small fraud using
    that? If you keep saying nothing and not responding, consumers
    will only feel that way!

This email was actually sent to a whole range of people,
including me. I think the list of recepients are other curl
copyright holders.
