# Question regarding you hacking my webserver?

    Hello and good morning/day/evening, My name is [name] and I
    am the owner and developer of [another name] [URL].
    Yesterday it has come to my attention that you infected my
    file system. It seems you may have targetted my Xenforo
    installation.

    While I am still investigating this issue and fixing my
    security vulnerabilities I must know. Why my server? My
    website isn't even public yet. I only came to know about it
    because my service provider told me attacks have been coming
    from my IP Address. I can not afford to lose my server as it
    is my livelihood, or up and coming one.

    Is there any information you can give me on cleaning it up
    or just on how to improve security? From your webpage you
    seem like nice people. I am not sure if that is misconstrued
    but you do seem nice. You can reach me at this email or at
    [email].

    Thank you.
