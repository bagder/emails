# thank you for your existence

    Subject: Just a quick thank you for your existence
    
    Hi Daniel,

    I was digging around in the credits section of an app (YouTube
    on my Xbox, actually), and I saw “libcurl” listed - and your
    name came up when I looked into it. I had no idea one person’s
    work has helped support so much of the internet I use every
    day.

    I just wanted to say: thank you. Not just for the code, but
    for the spirit behind it. The way you’ve built and shared
    libcurl, all these years, quietly powering so much without
    expecting credit… it really moved me. Most people never see
    that kind of work, but I stumbled across it and it left an
    impression.

    So this is just a small message to say:

    Thank you for existing.
