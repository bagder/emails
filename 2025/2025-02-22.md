# Interview request

    Hey Daniel!

    I was hoping to chat with you about libcurl â€” a source of my
    find it on their government laptop, with your name on the
    copyright. Are you around for a call sometime about it?

    Thank you!

This is not actually a weird email in itself. The fun part is just that
this person finds it so mysterious or strange that my name appears in a
"government laptop". What could possibly be the conspiracy behind this?
