# My car has a failure

    Hello Daniel.

    I am a owner of one of the Opel Astra vehicles in Trinidad
    and Tobago. My car has a failure, looking like not have a
    gasoline. Is what that say in the electronical gauge in the
    car, but the tank is full. And never started when I tried to
    do it.

    My car is automatic and has a presence key. To start the
    engine is pushing the bottom.

    This is the serial number for this car [redacted].

    Let me know what you recommended to do.

    Regards.
    [redacted]
